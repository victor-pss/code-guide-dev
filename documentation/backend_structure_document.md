# Backend Structure Document for code-guide-dev

This document explains how the backend side of **code-guide-dev** is set up. Since this project delivers static content rather than a traditional server-driven application, our "backend" focuses on how content is built, deployed, and served. You don’t need a deep technical background to follow along.

## 1. Backend Architecture

- We use a **static site generation** approach: all Markdown files are converted into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before they go live.  
- The core of this process is handled by **MkDocs** (with the Material theme) or **Sphinx** if we choose, running inside a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.  
- There is **no running application server or database** in production. Instead, the output is a folder of static files that any web server or CDN can serve.  

How this supports our goals:  
- **Scalability:** Static files can be served from multiple servers or CDNs without worrying about server load.  
- **Maintainability:** Content lives as Markdown in Git. Editing, versioning, and rollback all happen through familiar Git workflows.  
- **Performance:** Pages load very quickly because they’re pre-built and can be cached at edge locations worldwide.

## 2. Database Management

- **No database** is used, so there is no SQL or NoSQL store.  
- All content (text, images, code snippets) lives in the Git repository as Markdown files.  
- Version control via Git handles the history and branching of content, effectively replacing the need for a content database.

## 3. Database Schema

- Not applicable.  
- All "data" is simply file-based content organized in folders (`docs/`, `examples/`, `src/`), each containing human-readable Markdown documents.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

- There are **no runtime APIs** (REST or GraphQL) provided by code-guide-dev.  
- If external tools need to fetch content programmatically (for analytics or integration), they can use GitHub’s public REST API to read files or directory listings.  
- Example GitHub API endpoint (for reference):  
  GET https://api.github.com/repos/&lt;owner&gt;/code-guide-dev/contents/docs  

## 5. Hosting Solutions

- We host the static site on **GitHub Pages**, which is free, reliable, and integrates seamlessly with our Git workflow.  
- GitHub Pages automatically picks up the built site from the repository (or a dedicated deployment branch) and serves it over HTTPS.  
- Benefits:  
  - **Reliability:** GitHub ensures high uptime and CDN-backed delivery.  
  - **Scalability:** No limits on visitor traffic for standard documentation sites.  
  - **Cost-effectiveness:** Free hosting without needing to manage servers.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

These pieces work together behind the scenes to turn raw content into a live website:  

- **Git & GitHub**  
  - Version control, issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews.  
- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**  
  - Runs on every push or pull request:  
    • Installs Python/Node and site generator dependencies  
    • Runs `markdownlint` to catch style issues  
    • Builds the static site (MkDocs or Sphinx)  
    • Deploys to GitHub Pages when checks pass  
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**  
  - GitHub Pages leverages a global CDN, so visitors download assets from the nearest edge location.  
- **Browser Caching**  
  - Static assets (images, CSS, JS) include cache headers so repeated visits load instantly.

## 7. Security Measures

- **No secrets or credentials** are ever stored in the repository.  
- A `.gitignore` file excludes local environment files and any potential credentials from being committed.  
- **Branch protection rules** in GitHub prevent direct pushes to the main branch and require pull request reviews.  
- **CI checks** (linting, build) must pass before deployment—this prevents broken or malicious content from going live.  
- GitHub Pages serves content over **HTTPS** by default, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Build Status Badges** in the README show at a glance whether the latest CI build passed or failed.  
- **GitHub Insights** can track contributions, pull request response times, and issue trends.  
- **Periodic Dependency Updates:** We schedule a monthly check to update MkDocs, themes, and linters to their latest versions.  
- **Link and Accessibility Checks:** Future CI steps will include tools that verify no broken links exist and basic WCAG compliance.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

code-guide-dev uses a **JAMstack**-style backend: content lives in Git as Markdown, a CI pipeline builds a static site, and GitHub Pages hosts it. We avoid the complexity of servers and databases, yet gain:

- Rapid performance through pre-built pages and CDN delivery  
- Simple collaboration via Git workflows  
- Cost-effective, zero-maintenance hosting  

This setup aligns perfectly with our goal of a clear, easy-to-maintain developer guide that anyone can update. There’s no traditional backend code to run—everything you need is in the repository, and changes flow through an automated pipeline into a polished, public website.
