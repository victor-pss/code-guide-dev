# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

**Paragraph 1:**
The `code-guide-dev` repository is intended as the central hub for a comprehensive developer guide. Right now, it’s a blank canvas containing only a `README.md` file. Over time, this project will evolve into a structured collection of best practices, example code snippets, tutorials, and reference materials to help developers onboard quickly and follow consistent patterns.

**Paragraph 2:**
We’re building `code-guide-dev` to solve the problem of scattered or inconsistent documentation within our organization (or open-source community). The key objectives are clarity, ease of navigation, and practical examples that demonstrate each concept. Success means any new contributor or team member can find relevant information in under two minutes, follow step-by-step tutorials, and see well-structured code samples that they can adapt to their own projects.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope (for v0.1):**
- Initial `README.md` populated with:
  - Project purpose and vision
  - High-level directory structure plan
  - Contribution guidelines and branching strategy
- Skeleton folders:
  - `/docs` for markdown tutorials and guides
  - `/examples` for runnable code snippets
  - `/src` for reference implementations, if needed
- Basic linting configuration file (e.g., `.markdownlint.json`)
- A placeholder configuration for a static site generator (e.g., `mkdocs.yml` or `conf.py`)

**Out-of-Scope (deferred to later phases):**
- Full documentation content (detailed tutorials, API references)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines for doc builds and deployments
- Live hosting (GitHub Pages or other) fully configured and published
- Integration of interactive playgrounds or live code editors
- Multi-language translations of guides

## 3. User Flow

**Paragraph 1:**
A new user lands on the repository homepage and immediately sees a clear `README.md`. This file explains what the project is, why it exists, and how to get started. The next section points to the `/docs` folder for more detailed guides, the `/examples` folder for code snippets, and the `/src` folder for reference implementations. A visible link to contribution guidelines sets expectations for the development workflow.

**Paragraph 2:**
If the user clicks into `/docs`, they encounter a table of contents generated by MkDocs or a similar tool, guiding them through topics like project setup, coding standards, and best practices. When they explore `/examples`, they find small, self-contained scripts demonstrating common tasks (e.g., API calls, authentication). They can clone the repo, follow instructions, and run each example locally. Throughout, clear branching and PR guidelines ensure any community contributions follow the same pattern.

## 4. Core Features

- **README Introduction**: Detailed project vision, scope, and folder structure.
- **Directory Skeleton**:
  - `/docs`: Markdown files for guides and tutorials.
  - `/examples`: Code samples with README per example.
  - `/src`: Reference implementations or utilities.
- **Contribution Guide**: Templates for issues and pull requests, branching strategy.
- **Static Site Configuration**: Placeholder config for MkDocs or Sphinx.
- **Linting Setup**: Basic markdown lint rules (`.markdownlint.json`).
- **Template Files**: Sample markdown templates (e.g., guide template, example template).

---

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Version Control**: Git, hosted on GitHub.
- **Documentation Format**: Markdown (MD).
- **Static Site Generator (future)**: MkDocs (with Material theme) or Sphinx.
- **Linting**: markdownlint or Vale for style checks.
- **Potential IDE Integrations**:
  - VS Code + Markdown Preview Enhanced
  - GitHub Codespaces for live editing
- **Optional AI Assistants**:
  - GPT-4 or Claude for draft generation of guides and code examples (used during authoring).

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Readability**: All docs must meet a 9th-grade reading level, using clear headings and bullet lists.
- **Performance**: Static site pages should load in under 1 second over a standard broadband connection.
- **Organization**: Consistent file naming, directory structure, and front-matter for each markdown file.
- **Security**: No secrets or credentials in any files; `.gitignore` to exclude local environment files.
- **Accessibility**: Generated site should follow basic WCAG standards (e.g., alt text on images).

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- **Current State**: The repo is empty except for `README.md`; all structure and content is to be created.
- **Hosting**: We assume GitHub (or compatible) will host the static site—no custom server needed initially.
- **Tool Availability**: MkDocs and markdownlint must be installable via pip or npm in the CI environment.
- **AI Model**: If using an AI assistant for drafting content, we assume API access to GPT-4 is available.

---

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **Blank Canvas Risk**: With no existing content, contributors may disagree on structure. **Mitigation**: Lock the skeleton in a single PR and gather sign-off before expanding.
- **Documentation Drift**: As examples evolve, docs may become outdated. **Mitigation**: Add a CI check that ensures each example’s README includes a `tested against version` badge.
- **Toolchain Complexity**: Introducing Sphinx or MkDocs early may overcomplicate phase 1. **Mitigation**: Start with plain markdown and linting; layer in site generation in phase 2.
- **Naming Collisions**: Without clear naming guidelines, folder and file names may conflict. **Mitigation**: Include a naming convention section in the contribution guide.
