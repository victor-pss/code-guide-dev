# App Flow Document for code-guide-dev

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
A first-time visitor arrives either by navigating to the code-guide-dev repository on GitHub or by opening the live documentation site powered by MkDocs. There is no requirement to register or log in to explore the content. The landing page immediately displays the README section with the project title, a brief description of its purpose, and links to further documentation, examples, and contribution guidelines. If someone wishes to contribute code or documentation changes, they will use their existing GitHub account to fork the repository, clone it locally, and then create a pull request. No separate sign-up is needed, and password recovery or account management is handled entirely through GitHub’s own authentication system. Users who only want to read the guides and examples can do so without any sign-in at all.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After arriving on the live documentation site, the user sees a clean layout with a header bar showing the project name and a link to the GitHub repository. A collapsible sidebar on the left lists the main sections: Introduction, Directory Structure, Contribution Guide, Examples, and Reference Implementations. The central area greets the user with a concise welcome message explaining the repository’s purpose as a developer guide. Each section title in the sidebar is a clickable link that scrolls or navigates the user to that content. At the bottom of the sidebar, a theme toggle allows switching between light and dark modes. The header bar also presents a search box for quickly finding topics by keyword.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
When the user clicks on the Introduction link in the sidebar, the main panel scrolls to a page that outlines the vision and scope of code-guide-dev. From there, clicking on the Directory Structure link transitions to a page that describes the planned folders (`docs`, `examples`, `src`) and shows placeholder diagrams. Navigation remains consistent with the sidebar keeping the active section highlighted.

Exploring the Examples section begins by clicking on the “Examples” heading in the navigation. This loads a page listing each code sample by name, each entry linking to a subpage. Selecting an example opens its own documentation page where instructions to clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the code locally are presented. Each example page includes code snippets, expected outputs, and any configuration details.

The Reference Implementations section under `/src` behaves similarly. Users click its link in the sidebar, and the content panel presents skeleton files or future sample utilities. Each file name becomes a clickable link that opens a detailed view of that module’s purpose and usage.

When a user wants to contribute, they click the Contribution Guide section. This takes them to a page outlining how to create issues, follow the template provided, use branches named according to the contribution guidelines, and submit pull requests. Links on this page redirect to GitHub’s issue creation or pull request pages. After submitting a PR, the user can follow the conversation on GitHub until the maintainers merge their changes.

## Settings and Account Management
There is no built-in user account system within code-guide-dev itself. Instead, contributors use their GitHub credentials to manage forks and pull requests. For readers who want to customize their view of the docs site, the only available setting is the theme toggle, which remembers the user’s preference in the browser’s local storage. All other settings, such as editing the repository structure or adding content, require cloning the repo and updating files locally using a text editor or IDE. Once changes are ready, the contributor pushes branches to their fork and opens a GitHub pull request.

After updating personal preferences or completing local edits, users simply return to the main navigation by clicking the project logo in the header or the Home link in the sidebar to resume browsing the guide.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user attempts to navigate to a non-existent page in the documentation site, they are presented with a styled 404 page indicating that the page was not found. This page offers a link back to the home page and the search box so the user can easily find relevant content. In the code repository, if a broken link or missing file reference is detected during a future CI linting process, the deployment will fail and display an error message indicating which markdown file contains the invalid link. Contributors encountering merge conflicts during pull request reviews will see GitHub’s conflict resolution interface, guiding them to resolve overlapping changes before their branch can be merged. 

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
In summary, a user’s journey begins by landing on a clear README or documentation homepage without needing to sign in. From there, they navigate the sidebar to explore the project’s purpose, directory plan, and example code snippets. Contributors follow linked guidelines to fork, clone, edit, and submit pull requests using GitHub’s authentication. Theme preferences enhance the reading experience, and built-in error pages and CI checks help maintain content quality. The end goal for readers is to learn best practices and run example code, while contributors can efficiently expand and refine the guide, ensuring code-guide-dev evolves into a comprehensive development resource.
